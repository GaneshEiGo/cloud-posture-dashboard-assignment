# Cloud Posture Dashboard – Product Management Assignment

This repository contains my solution for the Product Management Trainee assignment.

## Problem

This assignment focuses on designing a calm, human-friendly cloud security experience that:
- Shows overall security posture clearly
- Helps prioritize critical issues
- Explains how to fix issues in simple terms
